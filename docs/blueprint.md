## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light periwinkle blue (#99ddff). Choosing a hue only a little to the "left" of 66ccff on the color wheel resulted in a fresher, lighter color.
- Background color: Very light cyan (#f0faff). To create a high-contrast, accessible color scheme, a brightness-adjusted, desaturated color sampled from the hue family of the primary was used.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#717CFF). A darker, saturated version of an analogous color ensures readability of text.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for headlines and body text
- The page layout is fully responsive to ensure proper display on various screen sizes.
- Subtle transitions when navigating between pages.
